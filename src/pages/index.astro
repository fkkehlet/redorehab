            <p>
              Or rather, the science is. Practical adoption remains slow, and many health professionals still, to this
              day, base their clinical practice on myths debunked decades ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outdated ideas harm people in very real ways. Well-intentioned as they may be, wrong explanations for pain
              and misguided advice on how to manage it can be distressing, disabling, and destroy lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              My name is Frederik, and I am among the growing number of "new-school" physiotherapists who work hard to
              evolve the traditional model, pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and skills to give people in pain the
              care they deserve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Building on a foundation of honest, open communication, I put <em class="not-italic underline">you</em>
               at the center of care. I will listen to your story, respect your decisions, and empower you with the
              tools you need to be more independent.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are capable of so much more than you think. You have the ability to overcome unimaginable obstacles
              and experience incredible personal growth along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              If what you're currently doing isn't working for you, don't hesitate to reach out for a consultation. If
              I'm not the right one to help you, I'll be the first to tell you.
            </p>
            <p>No magic pills. No quick fixes. No bullshit.</p>
