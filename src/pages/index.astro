              Or rather, the science is. Translation to the "real world" remains slow, and many health professionals to this day base
              their clinical practice on myths debunked decades ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outdated ideas damage people in very real ways. Well-intentioned as they may be, wrong explanations for pain
              and misguided advice on how to manage it can be very distressing and lead to disability. Harmful language ruins lives more often than one might think.

              My name is Frederik, and I'm one among the growing number of "new-school" physiotherapists who work hard to
              evolve the traditional model, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and skills to give people in pain
              the care they deserve.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know that you are capable of so much more. You have the ability to overcome unimaginable obstacles
              and experience incredible personal growth along the way. But to realize your true potential, it takes the
              right environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Building on a foundation of open communication and collaboration, I put <em
                class="not-italic underline">you</em
              >
               at the center of care. Together, we'll learn about your condition, set achievable goals, and build your
              confidence and independence.
            </p>
            <p>
              If what you're currently doing isn't working and it feels like you're running in circles, don't
              hesitate to reach out. I don't bite! And if I'm not the right person to help you, I'll be the first to
              say it.
